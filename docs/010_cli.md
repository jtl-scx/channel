# CLI Commands

Under `bin/Core.php` you will find a executable CLI tool (based on `symfony/console`) which will give you a wide range 
of tools to help you set up your own SCX-Channel integration. 

| Namespace | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `scx-api` | Contains command to send or receive data from the SCX-Channel API. |
| `chn` | Contains commands which may be helpful when setting up your own Channel Integration. | 
| `helper` | The namespace helper provides tools to create Seller-Events for testing purposes. | 

# Command `scx-api:get.events`

Read events available through `GET /channel/events` dispatch them in messages queues, using jtl/nachricht and 
acknowledge them by calling `DELETE /channel/events`. To consume these events use `scx-channel:event.consume`

# Command `chn:message.consume`

Consume all messages available through RabbitMQ

# Command `helper:emit.*`

Emit a test Event to RabbitMQ.

For example:
````
php bin/Core helper:emit.OfferNewEvent example/OfferNew.json $TESTSELLER
````
