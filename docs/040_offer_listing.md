# Offer Listing

## Create a new Offer Listing

Channel Api will send a `Seller:Offer.New` when a Seller want to list a Product on a certain marketplace. At this point
it depend on the connected Marketplace how a listing workflow may be implemented. The Example below show a very simple
listing process. Assume you will directly get a result back if a listing is `successful` or `failed`. For both cases you
should send a message about the result back to Channel Api to inform the Seller about the listing results.

use JTL\Nachricht\Contract\Emitter\Emitter;
use JTL\SCX\Lib\Channel\ChannelApi\SendOfferListingFailedMessage;
use JTL\SCX\Lib\Channel\ChannelApi\SendOfferListingInProgressMessage;

use JTL\SCX\Lib\Channel\Contract\Core\Log\ScxLogger;
use JTL\SCX\Lib\Channel\Core\Message\AbstractListener;
use JTL\SCX\Lib\Channel\Event\Seller\OfferNewEvent;

class OfferNewListener extends AbstractListener {

    private MyMarketplaceListingService $listingService;
    private Emitter $emitter;
    
    public function __construct(
        MyMarketplaceListingService $listingService, 
        Emitter $emitter, 
        ScxLogger $logger
    ) {
        parent::__construct($logger);
        $this->listingService = $listingService;
        $this->emitter = $emitter;
    }

    public function offerNew(OfferNewEvent $event): void 
    {
        $offerNew = $event->getEvent();
        $listingResults = $this->listingService->create($offerNew);
        
        if ($listingResults->listingSuccesful()) {
            $this->emitter->emit(new SendOfferListingSuccessfulMessage(/** parameters */));
            return;
        }
        
        if ($listingResults->listingFailed()) {
            $this->emitter->emit(new SendOfferListingFailedMessage(/** parameters */));
            return;
        }       
        
        // optional step: mark a listing as in progress when listing on a marketplace took longer than 5 minutes
        if ($listingResults->listingInProgress()) {
            $this->emitter->emit(new SendOfferListingInProgressMessage(/** parameters */));
            return;
        }
    }
}

As you may see in the example there is also a way to mark a Listing as `inProgress`. Many Marketplaces out there support
an asynchronous listing workflow. Where you first have to send the Product, the Marketplace will do same AI'Ã¬sch stuff 
to check whether your Product date is valid and not, and once the Product is listed successfully you may also create a 
offer for this Product.

If your Marketplace integration works this way, we recommend marking such `Seller:Offer.New` Event as `inProgress`.
In that case the status should be checked in a regular interval. You can do this by provides a `CLI` and run it using 
a Cron Job.

## Update Offer Listing

Channel Api will send a `Seller:Offer.Update` when a Seller want to update an existing Offer on a connected Marketplace.
The Event Schema does not differ from the Offer New Event and an Integration need to handle results in exactly the same 
way, by sending a `Successful`, `Failed` or `InProgress` message back to Channel Api.

## OfferId vs. ChannelOfferId

When you receive a `Seller:Offer.*` Event you will see a `offerId` and also a `channelOfferId`. The `offerId` is the
internal ID for an Offer created by a Seller Api integration (such as JTL-Wawi). This `offerId` is unique for a SellerId.
That means if you receive a `Seller:Offer.New` Event with `offerId=1` and later receive a `Seller:Offer.Update` with
the same ID, it references to the same Offer.

The `channelOfferId` is the ID from the Marketplace and should be used to identify an Offer Listing on a connected 
Marketplace. When a Channel receive a `Seller:Offer.StockUpdate` with only a `channelOfferId` it can simply try to 
update the Stock without knowing the Offer itself from a former `Seller:Offer.New` Event.
